This is a very preliminary cm-10.2 device tree.

Notice that I am not using arco's display-legacy repo now. It had to be changed for cm-10.2 compatibility. Use my cm-10.2 repo now.

The SDCARD doesn't mount. We need more work on fstab.tenderloin. The problem seems to be mounting a virtual disk using vold. 
I've been studying it but still haven't figured it out. It looks like there is some good information in sluo's github:
https://github.com/steven676/android-lvm-mod
Google really changed vold and it won't just let us mount dev/block/dm-6 anymore. I can manually mount the sdcard but it isn't vold managed so it doesn't really keep android happy. 
We don't need the file 10check_media_minor now because we nolonger use vold.fstab. I left the file in because we may need something like it to get vold to work. We also don't need recovery.fstab; it has been included in fstab.tenderloin.

No wifi, no sound, no bluetooth. Probably lots more missing. 

Here's the local_manifest.xml (local_manifests/roomservice.xml) file I use:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <project name="drmarble/android_device_hp_tenderloin" path="device/hp/tenderloin" remote="github" revision="cm-10.2-WIP" />
  <project name="CyanogenMod/hp-kernel-tenderloin" path="kernel/hp/tenderloin" remote="github" revision="ics" />
  <project name="CyanogenMod/android_hardware_atheros_wlan" path="hardware/atheros/wlan" remote="github" revision="jellybean" />
  <project name="drmarble/android_hardware_qcom_display-legacy" path="hardware/qcom/display-legacy" remote="github" revision="cm-10.2" />
  <project name="arco/android_hardware_qcom_media-legacy" path="hardware/qcom/media-legacy" remote="github" revision="cm-10.1_old" /> 
</manifest>

You need to add this before building:

pushd external/tinyalsa
# WIP: properly support multivalued controls
git fetch http://review.cyanogenmod.org/CyanogenMod/android_external_tinyalsa refs/changes/46/33646/1 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
popd


I think that this is everything. 
If you figure out how to fix something let me know on freenode #cyanogenmod-tenderloin, RootzWiki, XDA, or just do a pull request here.

Good luck to you all.
