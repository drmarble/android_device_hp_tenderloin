This is a somewhat less preliminary cm-10.2 device tree.

Notice that I am not using arco's display-legacy repo now. It had to be changed for cm-10.2 compatibility. Use my cm-10.2 repo now.

SDCARD mounts now! Folks with odd installs (linux/ubuntu etc.) may have problems. DONE-> thanks flintman! We need to modify prebuilt/etc/init.d/10check_media_minor for the new fstab.tenderloin to accomodate them. <-DONE

We have wifi and sound, still no bluetooth or hologram projector.

The sound is very touchy. You have to turn off touch sounds. They break sound. If a notififation sound is the rirst produced sound you also lose sound and the logcat gets filled with sound errors. You have to play another sound first and then sound will work untill the next reboot. I just start out with a quick round of angry birds. You can also begin with playing something in apollo. Just watch out for those touch sounds.

The wifi changes in wpa_supplicant_8 are again thanks to flintman. So are most of the sound changes in tinyalsa.

The kernel config is modified to get rid of SElinux errors. We still don't use it but we nolonger fill the logcat with errors. It still needs someone to configure it who understands how it works. Something about start in promiscuous mode, take the logs, analyze them and then set it up. 

Some recent changes to bootable recovery required that I break building CWM so we can keep our file system integrity with the custom fsck_msdos we build.

There are several new changes you will need from my github (you are already here): 
external/tinyalsa
external/wpa_supplicant_8
bootable/recovery
kernel/hp/tenderloin
device/hp/tenderloin
These all should have a cm-10.2-WIP branch with the latest commits. 

You will also need James C. Sullins' wifi tree. Clone https://github.com/jcsullins/backports-3.10-2 into external/backports. Go to the external directory, mkdir backports, cd backports, 
git clone https://github.com/jcsullins/backports-3.10-2.git 
Otherwise, you will get an rude compiler error message. You are free to do it differently, put the directory wherever you want, copy a zip, put it in your roomservice.xml, just get those files. Really, I should just build the files and include them in prebuilts like jcsullins did it. It will same some build time too. Added to my to do list.

Ignore my changes to atheros/wlan. That wasn't a good solution.

Here's the local_manifest.xml (local_manifests/roomservice.xml) file I use: (actually, this is out of date, I'm just feeling to lazy to type up a new one)
Just use "git remote add drmarble https://github.com/drmarble/android_external_wpa_supplicant_8.git" or whatever, use the little clone url button on the right side of the github screen for each repository. Or, just get my patches. If you go to the github commits and call one up, you can add .patch to the end of the url to get a plain text patch you can cut and paste into your editor.

I think that this is everything. 
If you figure out how to fix something let me know on freenode #cyanogenmod-tenderloin, RootzWiki, XDA, or just do a pull request here.

Good luck to you all.
