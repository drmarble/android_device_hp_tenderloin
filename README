This is a very preliminary cm-10.2 device tree.

Notice that I am not using arco's display-legacy repo now. It had to be changed for cm-10.2 compatibility. Use my cm-10.2 repo now.
https://github.com/drmarble/android_hardware_qcom_media-legacy/tree/cm-10.2

SDCARD mounts now! Folks with odd installs (linux/ubuntu etc.) may have problems. We need to modify prebuilt/etc/init.d/10check_media_minor for the new fstab.tenderloin to accomodate them.

No wifi, no sound, no bluetooth. Probably lots more missing. 

Here's the local_manifest.xml (local_manifests/roomservice.xml) file I use:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <project name="drmarble/android_device_hp_tenderloin" path="device/hp/tenderloin" remote="github" revision="cm-10.2-WIP" />
  <project name="CyanogenMod/hp-kernel-tenderloin" path="kernel/hp/tenderloin" remote="github" revision="ics" />
  <project name="CyanogenMod/android_hardware_atheros_wlan" path="hardware/atheros/wlan" remote="github" revision="jellybean" />
  <project name="drmarble/android_hardware_qcom_display-legacy" path="hardware/qcom/display-legacy" remote="github" revision="cm-10.2" />
  <project name="arco/android_hardware_qcom_media-legacy" path="hardware/qcom/media-legacy" remote="github" revision="cm-10.1_old" /> 
</manifest>

You need to add this before building:

pushd external/tinyalsa
# WIP: properly support multivalued controls
git fetch http://review.cyanogenmod.org/CyanogenMod/android_external_tinyalsa refs/changes/46/33646/1 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
popd


I think that this is everything. 
If you figure out how to fix something let me know on freenode #cyanogenmod-tenderloin, RootzWiki, XDA, or just do a pull request here.

Good luck to you all.
